        <h2>Hi I'm Kanami</h2>
          <p>I am a 28 year old ice cream lover. Originally from Tokyo, Japan, born to a mother who also list ice cream as the food she would eat everyday.</p>
          <p>I went to ballet school in Canada for two and a half years, and I currently reside in Austin, TX.</p>
          <p>I love eating, and because I love tasty food, I love to cook to create tasty dishes at home.</p>

      <h2>What's your favorite Ice cream flavor?</h2>
        <p>My favorite food is ice cream. I would eat them everyday if I could (I can't do that because I'm a dancer and need to have my body in control).</p>
        <p>This is a blog about my favorite ice cream flavors of all times and where to get the best of those flavors!</p>
